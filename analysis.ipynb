    "2) Convert notes to lowercase. There are long description of notes in menu.csv. It would make sense to have those notes lowercase. \n",

    "3) Cluster Events, since many different variations for the same word, such as Dinner having 10 different variations. Combining them gives much more clarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Converted Date String to Date Type so that analysis software can correctly recognize that the columns are indeed dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Most values in Dish.csv were numbers. Convert appropriate columns to number type.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Repeated same step as 5 for other sheets\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Removed Menu Items whose price is greater than $100,000, as a menu item greater than 100,000 is not resonable\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Used Text Faucet and clustering in Venue. Similar reason to #3, where we don't want variations of text that is representing the same word. \n",
    "\n",
    "9) Used Date Faucet in First_Appeared_Year and Last_Appeared in Dish.CV to remove years greater than 2025, since it is not possible for menu items to appear in years greater than 2025 (as of the current date)"

    "To summarize, in this project we initially set out to address the data quality problem of repeated dish names in the Dish dataset by standardizing dish names. Without standard naming conventions in place, it is impossible to perform accurate analysis on the popularity and pricing trends of dishes. Dishes whose names are mispelled, or use different terminology to refer to the same thing, create erroneous data with separate line items for producsts that should otherwise be examined together as a whole. To promote standardization, we leverage OpenRefine to merge similarly named dishes under the assumption that differences between certain dish names reflect true data quality issues. To analyze and quantify our results, and to determine whether or not we were indeed successful in improving data quality in our approach, we make use of Python; we employ packages in Python such as Pandas, which allows us to read our original and cleaned datasets into DataFrames, and PandaSQL to execute our queries for measuring data quality. We find that...\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this project, we divided the work up evenly among our group members based on our respective domain expertise. Anshul, having the most experience and comfort using OpenRefine, took care of the actual merging of dish names and our data cleaning steps within that platform. Blake and Abduhamdan, being more comfortable with analysis in Python, handled the queries and measurement framework to examine and quantify the results. "
